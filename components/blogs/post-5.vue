    <p class="font-normal tracking-normal text-tmrw-dark-grey mb-5">Creativity is the name of the game, but it can be challenging to be creative when you often feel like you’re burning out. It can be especially difficult for creatives whose jobs depend on being innovative and original every day. Find out how we beat the inevitable creative burnout and take care of both your physical and mental health.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold uppercase text-tmrw-red mb-3">Draw Your Boundaries</h3>
    <p class="font-normal tracking-normal text-tmrw-dark-grey mb-5">Boundaries are a great starting point for you to lower the risk of burnout while you manage and improve your work-life balance. With boundaries set in place, break away from the hustle and bustle of work and set aside non-working hours to make time for the things that do matter — spend time with your family and friends, or give yourself the TLC you need to feel refreshed and revitalised.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold uppercase text-tmrw-red mb-3">Change Up Your Routine</h3>
    <p class="font-normal tracking-normal text-tmrw-dark-grey mb-5">Your everyday routine can get, well, routine. If you find yourself needing a fresh perspective on things, switch up your scenery to keep your creative ideas fresh. Be it working from a new location to feel rejuvenated or changing up your work schedule, welcome the new change and keep an open mind for any unexpected inspirations.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold uppercase text-tmrw-red mb-3">Find An Unrelated Creative Outlet</h3>
    <p class="font-normal tracking-normal text-tmrw-dark-grey mb-5">Whether you start a new hobby or take to a different creative outlet, give your mind a rest. From painting and knitting to coming up with music of your own, choose a relaxing activity that is unrelated to your profession; something that will balance it out, help inspire you and get your creative juices flowing.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold uppercase text-tmrw-red mb-3">Take Time Off To Wind Down</h3>
    <p class="font-normal tracking-normal text-tmrw-dark-grey mb-5">Taking a break from your daily tasks is a good way to escape the cycle and come back to your creativity afresh. Go for a walk. Watch cute puppy videos. Read a book, take a nap or do absolutely nothing. Taking a proper break will not only boost your productivity, but it will also enhance your creativity. </p>
    <p class="font-normal tracking-normal text-tmrw-dark-grey">Here’s my final take. While you might find it challenging to give yourself the space and care you need to get out of a creative slump, remind yourself to be good to yourself and strategise healthier ways of being productive so you don’t run yourself into the ground.</p>
